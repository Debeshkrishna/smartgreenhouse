 Introduction: Smart Greenhouse Monitoring System**

Agriculture is evolving with the integration of smart technologies to ensure efficient, sustainable, and productive farming. A **Smart Greenhouse Monitoring System** is one such innovation aimed at automating and optimizing the growth conditions of plants inside a greenhouse.

This project uses **Arduino Uno** as the central microcontroller, integrated with a set of environmental sensors to continuously monitor the conditions essential for plant growth:

* **Soil Moisture Sensor**: Detects the water content in the soil to help automate irrigation.
* **Light Sensor (LDR or BH1750)**: Measures ambient light to ensure plants are receiving adequate sunlight.
* **DHT11/DHT22 Sensor**: Monitors **temperature** and **humidity**, helping maintain the ideal environment for plant health.

These sensors collect real-time data and feed it to the Arduino, which processes the information and can trigger automatic responses like:

* Turning on water pumps when soil is dry
* Controlling grow lights if natural light is insufficient
* Managing ventilation fans when the temperature or humidity exceeds limits

By maintaining optimal environmental conditions, this system not only reduces manual labor but also improves crop quality and conserves resources like water and energy.
